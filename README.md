# Dotfiles

These are all of my dotfiles, for now it only contains cross-platform software to sync between my MacOS and Linux machines. The plan is to add everything eventually, but for now I'm just keeping it simple.


## Requirements
For the dotfiles to function properly, install the following.

- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation),
  [fd-find](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on the platform)
- [GoogleSansCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/E-Vertin/GoogleSansCode-NerdFont)
